# HUB: Multi-loader Lobby Router

<!-- modrinth_exclude.end -->

HUB is a lobby routing plugin for Minecraft networks. It runs primarily on Velocity and ships additional loaders for Paper, Fabric, NeoForge, and Minestom. The goal is to route players quickly and correctly based on permissions, priorities, and rules.

## Key Points
- Multi-loader support (Velocity, Paper, Fabric, NeoForge, Minestom).
- Priority + permission based selection with parent lobby groups.
- Regex filters for lobby matching and command hiding.
- Auto-select on join and on server kick with fallback logic.
- Debug toolkit for live checks and fast reloads.
- Web config builder to edit without YAML.
